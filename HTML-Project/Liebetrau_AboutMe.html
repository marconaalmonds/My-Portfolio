      <!--About Me content-->
      <div class="col-8">
         <p>My name is Kevin Liebetrau, I am currently a junior in the 2021 class at Dublin High School, and I am passionate about the fields of science and engineering.  I live with my mother and father, as well as one dog and one cat.  I also have a brother who’s away in college right now, as he is two years older than me.  Course wise, I am currently enrolled in AP Chemistry, Computer Science Principles, Precalculus, Spanish 4 Honors, US History, and AP Language Arts.  Out of all of these, Computer Science Principles and AP Chemistry are by far the most interesting and engaging, both requiring higher level thinking and problem solving skills that aren’t as necessary in my other courses.  Although this makes them more difficult, they are something classes worth the extra work for the experience they give me.  I hope to continue on the path of science and possibly engineering in the future, especially in college or in the professional workplace.  I find chemistry and other applied sciences to be very interesting and applicable to jobs and even to things in everyday life, but I’m not entirely sure where exactly I want to go for college at this point in time, or even what I want to study.  As for some things that I’ve done in the past, CSP had projects that we had to complete in two different systems, one being Scratch and the other MIT App Inventor.  Outside of school I take part in a Park Cleanup Club, I do volunteer work in areas such as food kitchens or helping out at the local churches.  I hope in the future to take part in the Habitat for Humanity program, and to help create new homes and shelters for those who don’t have them.  Academically I hope to get at least a 1500 on the Sat, as well as a 4.0 during all semesters of Junior and Senior year for college credit.  
         That was a little information about me, so now you’re free to enjoy the website!
