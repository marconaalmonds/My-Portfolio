			  <h1>Scratch Project</h1>

			  <h4>Course: Computer Science Principles</h4>
			  <p>This was the first project assigned in Computer Science Principles, with the intention of teaching us the basics of
				Scratch as well as collaboration with our peers. This was assigned in teams of two for us to work on. The process of
				actually creating a game proved to be more difficult than I had originally thought it would be. Firstly, even coming
				up with an idea for a game was challenging in that we had to find an idea, which we were able to complete within the
				time, that was also challenging to create, but not impossible to play. One of the things that we discovered quickly was
				that creating the baseline for the programming is difficult, and that every aspect of the game usually have several aspects
				which serve to create its functions. Overall, the project served as a good base for programming, and a learning experience
				in how to efficiently work with other people, and how to distribute work. </p>

        <h1>MIT App Inventor Project</h1>
        <h4>Course: Computer Science Principles</h4>
        <p>This was the second project assigned, to be done in groups of two.  The purpose was to show our skill with MIT App Inventor, as well as to improve our collaboration skills, and introduce a new programming system which is more similar to actual programming than Scratch.  The baseline idea portion of this project was relatively easy, as other students and groups took many of the ideas that my partner and I considered, and so we were effectively left with a few choices.  We selected that choice that seemed to fit our ability level the best, while also being easy to edit and make additions to.  We were given the base code for the project to copy, and so following that the largest difficulty was in thinking of new ways to change the quiz app, and then actually implementing those changes.  I learned more about how to work with others and separate work, as well as how to create apps for android devices, and finally, more about how various elements interconnect with one another to create a working application.</p>
